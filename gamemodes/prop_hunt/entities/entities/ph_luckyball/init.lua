	Usage: 
	luckyball would only spawn when there is a map's prop that is about to break. (e.g: user is raging out and destroy the innocent prop_physics)

	Please Note:
	Force-Spawning may result in unbalancing gameplay. Admins/Owner should consider to avoid this way.

	Description:
	A Very Rare Drop. (8-9/1000 of chance, ..kindof.)
	This entity will spawn after you break at the props and It'll give an extra.. 'Something' when a player is pressing +USE key.
	Pretty based from Terraria/Minecraft. This drop can spawns something bad, good, neutral or doesn't do anything.
	Why I do this because, I just want to add more 'arcade' stuff since Prop Hunt meant to be fun with Arcade features would be good idea :3
